### Minor Changes

- 29621a7: A field name is an identity, and two of them cannot collide

  Generated ids are `${widgetId}__${part}`. A field named `a__label` therefore lands on the same id as
  field `a`'s label, in a different role — and the browser is perfectly happy to hold two elements
  with one id, so `getElementById`, `label[for]` and every ARIA IDREF quietly stop being
  deterministic. The failure is invisible until two particular fields share a page.

  **`__` is now forbidden in a field name** rather than escaped. Escaping would have encoded `_`,
  changing the id of every field whose name contains one, and those ids are consumer-visible —
  selectors and tests are written against them. Forbidding costs nothing by comparison: an id built
  from a name containing the delimiter was never deterministic, so nothing correct is taken away. The
  dynamic parser drops such a field with a warning, as it already does for names containing `.`;
  `mountMdyForm` throws, because a typed call site can be told at the call site.

  `MDY_ID_DELIMITER` and `isValidWidgetId` are exported so a consumer can check a name before
  building one. The delimiter lives in `@modyra/core` — the parser needs it and core cannot import
  `@modyra/widgets` — and is re-exported from `@modyra/widgets` where the id policy lives.

  **`mountMdyForm` also rejects duplicate names.** Two definitions sharing one used to collapse
  silently: the second overwrote the first in the name map, the `rendered` set stopped the first from
  drawing, and the form came out with one instance where the caller asked for two — a difference
  visible only by counting. The dynamic parser already refused duplicates; the typed entry point now
  holds the same precondition, and names the duplicate.

  **If you have a field whose name contains `__`**, rename it. It was already producing colliding ids;
  this only makes the collision say so.

- 46e6a0e: A popup goes in the top layer, so nothing above it can move it

  `@modyra/plain` positions a popup from viewport coordinates and lets the foundation apply them to a
  `position: fixed` box. That only holds while no ancestor is a containing block for fixed
  descendants — and anything carrying `contain: layout` becomes one, which is exactly what
  `container-type` implies. The foundation needs `container-type` on the form so a row can ask how wide
  the _form_ is rather than how wide the window is, and without this change that would have quietly
  moved four popups by the form's own offset.

  `setOverlayOpen(popup, open)` is now the one place that decides how a popup is shown, the way one
  place already decides where it is placed — the six fields each assigned `hidden` themselves before.
  It sets `popover="manual"` and calls `showPopover()`/`hidePopover()`, keeping `hidden` in step so the
  two can never disagree. `manual` rather than `auto`: light-dismiss would close the popup before this
  renderer's own outside-pointer handling ran, and two things closing one popup is how a click-through
  appears.

  Four of the six popups — colors, datepicker, daterange, timepicker — live in their field's own
  subtree and are the ones this protects. `select` and `multiselect` already portal to `document.body`,
  so nothing in the form could contain them; they move to the top layer too, for one behaviour rather
  than two.

  It also fixes a standing bug in its own right: a popup could be clipped by an `overflow: hidden`
  ancestor, and in the top layer it cannot be.

  The foundation adds one declaration, `.mdy-popup[popover] { position: fixed }`. Every other UA
  popover style — the centring insets, the default border, padding, background and width — is already
  answered by the contract's own `.mdy-popup` rule, which outranks the UA sheet.

- b0aa545: Contract v3: a slot says where it sits and whether it shows

  v2 made a row's track count authorable per size. What it could not express is anything about one
  child of that row: a field that moves to another column on a wide screen, or that is not shown on a
  phone. Those are properties of the slot, not of the row, and there was nowhere to put them.

  **Contract v3** adds one thing — a slot that says more than its name:

  ```json
  {
    "ref": "coupon",
    "at": { "base": { "hidden": true }, "md": { "column": 2, "hidden": false } }
  }
  ```

  A bare string still means "this field, wherever the row puts it", and the two spellings mix freely
  inside one row. `column` is 1-based and refused when it names a track the row does not have;
  `hidden` is a boolean; a size that says neither is refused as the typo it usually is.

  **The row's track count stays where v2 put it.** `at` on the columns node keeps meaning what it
  means, rather than being respelled as `{ columns: n }`. One property, one spelling — a second way to
  say the same thing would leave every reader deciding which wins, and would force a v2 row to be
  rewritten to say what it already says. Everything else in a v3 document — `fields`, `schema`,
  `layout`, `rules` — is v2's, unchanged, so **a v2 document is a v3 document with the version raised**,
  and v2 keeps parsing exactly as before. A v3 slot inside a v2 document is refused: accepting it would
  make this parser disagree with every other reader of the same bytes.

  The placement lands on the **column**, not on a wrapper inside it, because the column is the grid
  item — `grid-column` and `display` are properties of one, and nothing nested inside a cell can move
  itself into a different track however it is styled. A column holding several slots takes the first
  placement it is given, which is exactly how every row Studio authors is built.

  `layoutSlotStyle` in `@modyra/widgets` turns `at` into custom properties, and the foundation reads
  them through the same mobile-first cascade the track count already uses: what a size does not say, it
  inherits from the next smaller one. Visibility is a `display` value rather than a class for that
  reason — a class cannot be undone at a larger size without a second class saying the opposite, and
  "hidden on a phone, shown from tablet" is the case worth having.

  Both config-driven renderers honour it: `@modyra/plain` and `<mdy-dynamic-form>`.

- e5eb12d: Checkbox gains a contract `indicator` part; the toggle keeps its shape

  The checkbox's drawn box is now a real element every renderer emits (`mdy-checkbox__indicator`),
  the counterpart of the toggle's `track`/`thumb`. It used to be a pseudo-element on the _label_, so
  the tick was positioned against the text and drifted off centre whenever the label's height
  changed; it is now centred by the box that contains it.

  The toggle's thumb keeps one geometry in both states and only travels — a knob that also grew
  between off and on read as two different controls. Travel uses `inset-inline-start` plus a signed
  translation, so it runs the correct way in RTL, and it is suppressed under reduced motion.
  `--mdy-toggle-thumb-size-checked` is deprecated: it now resolves to `--mdy-toggle-thumb-size`.

  Overlays take their surface, outline, radius and shadow from the active theme's semantic tokens
  instead of a fixed panel, so a popup is never a light card floating over a dark theme.

- c2fc744: The chip is a contract, and the multiselect wears Angular's anatomy

  Every renderer spelled its own chip: `"mdy-chip mdy-chip--counter"` in one, a ternary for
  `--selected` in another. `MDY_CHIP_CLASSES` names the primitive and its variants, and
  `multiselectChipClasses({ mode, role, selected })` answers what a chip carries — the mode picks the
  variant, selection is a state on top of it, never a variant of its own. Angular, Lit and the
  framework-free renderer all ask it, so the foundation's `.mdy-chip--selected` is the only place that
  decides what a taken chip looks like.

  The multiselect's anatomy is now Angular's, which is the reference: the options are chips in a grid
  _in the field_, under a header whose search button opens a popup holding the same grid over a filter
  box. `options`, `header` and `optionWrapper` are named; the popup's grid carries the shared class
  plus the overlay one, so one rule lays out both. A compact trigger showing value chips stays
  declared and optional.

  Found while checking it in a browser: the foundation read `--mdy-sys-*` and `--mdy-ref-*` without
  fallbacks, so in the default and Material themes a chip had no border and no corners —
  `border: 1px solid var(--mdy-sys-color-outline)` is dropped entirely when that token is absent. All
  155 now resolve to the tier's own values, and the audit covers the system and reference tiers too.

- 05c5665: A disabled field is no longer submitted or validated

  `disabled` and `readonly` were the same thing in everything but name. Both blocked interaction
  identically, both were kept in the submitted value, and both were validated. The standards say
  otherwise, and had done all along: a disabled control is neither submitted nor validated, and a
  read-only one is both.

  **Interactivity is now one value, not two flags.** `MdyFieldState.interactivity` is
  `"enabled" | "readonly" | "disabled"`, and `disabled`/`readonly` are derived from it, so the
  meaningless `disabled && readonly` combination cannot be represented. If a form sets both, disabled
  wins: it permits strictly less, and a question the form is not asking cannot also be one it is
  asserting an answer for.

  **Two value types, because there are two concepts.** `form.value()` and `form.getValue()` stay
  total — that is the live editing model, and drafts, history and cross-field validators all read it,
  so a field must not vanish from it just because it happens to be disabled. `form.submitValue()` is
  new and returns `MdySubmittedValue<S>`, which is what actually leaves the browser. `submit()`'s
  callback now receives that type.

  `MdySubmittedValue<S>` is optional at every level the schema declares and no deeper: a leaf inside a
  group can be disabled on its own, so groups recurse, while an object-valued _leaf_ like a date range
  is submitted whole or not at all. `MdyFormAdapter` gained a second type parameter for it, defaulting
  to `Partial<T>`, so adapters that do not know their schema are unaffected.

  **What changes for you.**

  - A form containing a disabled field now sends less. Read the submitted value defensively; the type
    will tell you where.
  - A form blocked by a disabled required-empty field now submits. That case was unfixable by the
    user, who could not type into the field either.
  - `MdyFormSubmitEvent.value` and `onSubmit` callbacks are typed as the submitted shape.
  - A read-only field is unaffected: still submitted, still validated, still focusable.

- 242551e: What a field holds when it holds nothing is now the contract's answer, not a renderer's.
  `mdyEmptyValueFor` moves the per-kind table into `@modyra/core`, where `required` already lives —
  two adapters answering the question separately is how one form validates differently in each.

  Two defects were sitting in the old table, both measured:

  - **A required number field could never fail.** It defaulted to `0`, and zero is a number the user
    may well mean, so `required` accepted a field nobody had filled in. It is now `null`.
  - **A slider started outside its own range.** It defaulted to `0` whatever its `min`, so a slider
    bounded 10–20 sat at 0 until the first drag. It now starts at its minimum.

  The slider is the one kind whose empty value is a real one, and deliberately so: a thumb is always
  somewhere, so an untouched slider reads as filled. Every other kind is now rejected by `required` at
  its empty value, and a test asserts exactly that across the whole kind list — which is the check that
  would have caught the `0`.

  `<mdy-dynamic-form>` used the same function instead of spelling the defaults per kind in its
  template — a third table, which defaulted only checkbox, toggle and multiselect and left a number
  field `undefined`.

  **Breaking for `@modyra/plain`**: a `number` field with no `initialValue` starts `null` rather than
  `0`, and a `slider` starts at `min`. Set `initialValue` to keep the old behaviour. The same applies to `<mdy-dynamic-form>`, where a
  number field previously started `undefined` and a slider ignored its `min`.

- a8606da: One chip vocabulary for the multiselect, so every renderer draws Angular's chip

  The multiselect contract now names the chip anatomy the Angular renderer established — `mdy-chip`
  with `mdy-chip__check`, `mdy-chip__label`, and, in counter mode, `mdy-chip__btn` and
  `mdy-chip__count` — as the `option`, `optionCheck`, `optionLabel`, `optionStep` and `optionCount`
  parts. The controller projects `mdy-chip--centered` or `mdy-chip--counter` per mode and
  `mdy-chip--selected` per option, so an option looks the same whichever framework rendered it.
  Plain renders that anatomy; the theme draws the tick for renderers that ship no icon set.

  The chips a closed trigger shows now carry `mdy-chip--value`, which distinguishes a readout of the
  current selection from an option a user can pick.

  `MdyDynamicOptionsField` gains `mode: "single" | "multi"`, so a multiselect whose options can be
  taken several times is expressible in a form config rather than only through a renderer argument.

- 6bdfb02: One call turns a placement into the class the catalog names it

  `above` and `overlay` are states of every popup part, but each adapter had to know how to ask: read
  the part's first class, suffix it, and skip `below` because the catalog gives it no class. Three
  adapters, three copies of that reasoning, and a fourth about to be written for Studio.

  `popupPlacementClass(kind, placement)` is that reasoning, once, in `@modyra/widgets`. It answers with
  the class or with `null` when the popup sits in the ordinary place. Every adapter now calls it:

  - `@modyra/plain` keeps the decision it already held, so `releaseOverlayPlacement` is unchanged.
  - `@modyra/angular` — `<mdy-overlay-panel>` computes it from its `kind`; `select` and `colors` own
    the element the state belongs on and compute it themselves. The `[class.…--above]` literals are
    gone from both.
  - `@modyra/lit` gains `popupClass(placement)` on the base, and `renderOverlayPanel` stops emitting
    `mdy-overlay-panel--above` / `--overlay`. Six components moved: `select` and `colors` off
    hand-spelled literals, and `datepicker`, `daterange`, `timepicker` and `multiselect` gained a
    placement class they never had.

  **No adapter emits `mdy-overlay-panel--above` or `--overlay` any more.** Nothing in the workspace ever
  styled them. A host that wrote its own rule against those names should move it to the widget's popup
  class — `mdy-select__dropdown--above`, `mdy-datepicker__popup--above`, and so on.

  The two audits that read class names out of renderer source resolve the call rather than looking for
  a literal, the way they already resolved `multiselectChipClasses`. Without that, an adapter moving
  onto the contract reads as one that stopped emitting the classes altogether — which is precisely the
  regression the audits exist to catch, reported backwards.

- 8e1dc80: Anchoring is a contract, and all three adapters apply it

  `anchorOverlay` in `@modyra/widgets` turns a measured anchor and viewport into the placement, the
  alignment, the height, the width and the exact `--mdy-overlay-*` coordinates a popup needs. Plain,
  Lit and Angular now measure and apply; none of them computes a position of its own. It takes
  `current` to keep an open popup's shape steady while its anchor moves, and `lock` for a host that
  tracks the chosen corner itself — the locked height is measured for the locked side rather than
  inherited from the side the policy would otherwise have picked.

  Positioning also stops being something a theme can take back. The popup primitives are declared
  last in the components layer, so no earlier per-widget rule can override an overlay's placement,
  and Modern's docked `top: calc(100% + …)` rules are gone: a theme that positioned an overlay was
  deciding whether a popup landed on its own control.

  Every renderer now anchors popups to the control wrapper, as Angular always did — Lit anchored to
  the whole field (label included, opening a row low and 240px off) and Plain's pickers were docked
  inside the field with no shared positioning at all. Verified in the browser across five widgets in
  two demos: 6px gap, aligned to the anchor's edge, stable under scroll.

  The theme audit now reads Angular's `[panelClass]`, which had made every popup class Angular emits
  invisible to it.

- d21390f: Overlays keep their shape, never take part in layout, and always sit above field feedback

  Every `popup` part in the catalog now carries `MDY_POPUP_CLASS` (`mdy-popup`), and the foundation
  takes anything wearing it out of flow. Lit's multiselect rendered its overlay content into a
  `display: contents` panel, so the options were laid out inline and pushed the page down on open;
  that guarantee is now the contract's rather than each renderer's.

  `stabilizeOverlayPlacement` keeps an open overlay's side, height and alignment fixed while its
  anchor moves: coordinates follow the anchor, but re-deciding the shape on every scroll frame is
  what made popups flip and resize as the page scrolled. Plain holds the decision for the lifetime
  of one opening.

  `@modyra/styles` gains a documented stacking scale (`--mdy-z-raised` … `--mdy-z-portal`) and the
  raw `z-index: 999/1000/9999` values now take rungs from it, with errors and supporting text placed
  below overlays so field feedback can never cover an open popup. Segments are equal-width with the
  check gutter reserved in every state, so selection no longer resizes the bar and two renderers with
  different labels produce the same geometry. The toggle track is border-box, so its height and
  radius no longer change between off and on. Plain's select renders the contract's `placeholder`
  part instead of a modifier class on the value, and its radio/segmented options put the drawn
  control on its own element rather than on the native input.

  The Angular UI golden baseline changes only by the three CDK popups gaining `mdy-popup`.

- fd87ae7: A placement belongs to a column, and now says so everywhere

  Contract v3 shipped a gap: a slot's `at` parsed anywhere a slot could appear, but only a column could
  act on it. A slot in a section was accepted and then silently ignored by every renderer — the exact
  failure the strict parser exists to prevent.

  **Placement is now refused where it cannot be honoured.** `at` is valid only inside a `columns` row,
  including for a section at the top of a layout, which occupies no column. A slot with no `at` is
  still a field name written longhand and is fine anywhere.

  **And it is now possible where it was needed.** A group compiles to a section, so a group in a row
  could be moved and hidden per size in Studio and the compiler dropped both without a word. A section
  occupying a column carries the same `at` a slot does, read by the same code in both renderers — the
  column is the element either way. Studio's group box gains the controls its fields already had:
  left/right, columns-across, and the eye.

  Also closed, all of them ways the same feature could be silently lost:

  - A `column` past a row's tracks — what a row narrowing under it leaves behind — is trimmed at
    compile time. It used to reach the parser, be refused, and take the whole layout down with it.
  - The compiled version is read off the finished layout rather than tracked while building it, so a
    document cannot claim v3 for a placement that was trimmed away after the slot carrying it was
    emitted.
  - `layoutNodeAttributes` reads only numbers from `at`. Row counts and slot placements share the key
    across the layout union, and a placement reaching it became `NaN` tracks.
  - A group in a column laid its legend out on one unwrapped line: a dozen controls, 267px of them in a
    135px column, overflowing onto the column beside it where they took the clicks meant for its
    buttons. The action bar now folds inside its own column — scoped there deliberately, since at full
    width it fits on one line and folding it would only make every row taller.

- 26017d8: Render `daterange` for real in the framework-free renderer: two endpoints, a separator, a toggle and
  a calendar popup driven by the widgets range policy, committing and closing as soon as the second
  endpoint is picked. The calendar body is shared with the datepicker and now carries the contract's
  full anatomy — a weekday header and one row per week — with month and weekday names, and the first
  day of the week, taken from Intl via `buildDateLocale`. Selecting a date in the datepicker likewise
  closes the overlay and restores focus to the trigger.
- e0a4cef: Render `file` and `colors` for real, retiring the placeholder renderer: a drop zone with a browse
  button, a file list and a clear action driven by `fileSelectionTransition`, and a colour control with
  a preview swatch, hex field and preset palette driven by `colorValueTransition` — which is also what
  decides that picking a preset closes the popup while typing a hex value does not. Popups are placed
  through a shared helper that applies `decideOverlayPlacement` and writes the `--mdy-overlay-*`
  properties the themes read. The catalog now names the classes for these parts, so an adapter takes
  them from the contract instead of inventing them, and the caret a renderer without an icon set
  leaves empty is drawn by the theme through `:empty` rather than by naming that renderer.
- 9f0732c: Portal Plain select overlays beyond clipped renderer containers and complete the Modern theme for the Plain host, listbox overlay and toggle presentation while preserving Widgets behavior and accessibility state.
- 623f3fc: Multiselect opens an overlay, and the themes stop knowing which renderer drew the DOM

  Plain's multiselect now renders a trigger with selection chips plus a portalled popup holding the
  filter field and the option chips, instead of laying every option out inline — opening it no longer
  resizes the field and pushes the rest of the form down the page. Its select renderer drops its
  private positioning code for the shared `positionOverlay`/`trackOverlay` helpers.

  `@modyra/styles` gains a foundation `.mdy-overlay` primitive: any popup portalled out of its own
  subtree carries the class, the renderer writes `--mdy-overlay-*`, and the foundation owns the
  positioning, clipping and `[hidden]` behaviour. Modern's `.mdy-plain-select__portal`,
  `.mdy-plain-form` and `.mdy-plain-{date,time}picker` rules are gone with it, so no theme file
  contains an adapter-specific selector any more.

- df563d4: The optional parts that only exist once something is supplied are built and checked for the first
  time, and building them found three contract defects.

  `clear` no longer hangs from `fileItem`. Every renderer puts one clear button beside the file list,
  because clearing empties the field rather than one row — the contract asked for it inside an item.
  `mdy-file-name` and `mdy-file-meta` join the file kind's presentation classes; both were rendered and
  neither was declared.

  Plain gains the two affordances it never had. `loading` on select and multiselect shows on the
  control, matching the other adapters, so its state matrix no longer reports the state as undrivable.
  `prefix` and `suffix` render on the free-text kinds when the field supplies content for them — an
  empty affix is a gap the theme still spaces, so they appear only when there is something to put in
  them. Both arrive as optional properties on the dynamic field config.

  Counter mode was the same story. `optionStep` and `optionCount` exist only on a multiselect in
  `"multi"` mode and no fixture had ever used it, which is why `mdy-chip--centered` was declared and
  its opposite `mdy-chip--counter` was not. `optionCheck` stops being mandatory: a counter chip has a
  count between two steppers and no tick, so requiring it asked every counter-mode renderer for an
  element that means nothing there.

  New coverage, each falsified by breaking the renderer it checks: a file field with files chosen, a
  text field with both affixes, Lit's slotted affixes, and the value-chip presentation the multiselect
  catalogue declares as its compact alternative — declared, styled and reachable through
  `multiselectChipClasses`, and until now never once constructed.

- 6d000c1: A popup says which side it landed on, in the one name the contract gives it

  The catalog has declared `above` and `overlay` as states of every popup part for some time. No
  renderer used them. Angular and Lit each spelled the same idea as `mdy-overlay-panel--above` /
  `--overlay` on a wrapper element — a name the catalog never gave and no stylesheet has ever
  matched — and `@modyra/plain` wrote `data-placement` instead. One decision, three spellings, none of
  them styled.

  The cost was not theoretical. The foundation carried a rule that reversed a multiselect's popup when
  it opened upwards, so the filter box sits nearest the control the user just clicked. It was keyed on
  the overlay panel's `--above`, which nothing emits, so **an upward-opening multiselect has always put
  its filter at the top, furthest from the pointer.** Coordinates cannot express that: `top` and `left`
  put the box somewhere, they cannot tell a stylesheet which way it went.

  `overlayAnchoringFor(kind)` now carries the `kind` it was asked about. `anchorOverlay` does not read
  it — placement is geometry — but a renderer holding an anchoring now holds everything needed to name
  the result, so `@modyra/plain` reflects the placement through `partClasses(kind, "popup", …)` with no
  change at any call site. `below` carries no class, exactly as the catalog documents, so an ordinary
  popup is spelled like one nobody has placed.

  `MdyPopupWidgetKind` is derived from the catalog — the kinds whose contract declares a `popup` part.
  Asking `partClasses` for a checkbox's popup now fails to compile rather than at runtime, and a widget
  that gains or loses a popup changes the type by changing its own definition. A test asserts anchoring
  and a popup part always travel together, since `overlayAnchoringFor` reports the narrowed kind on the
  strength of the anchoring guard alone.

  The foundation's reversal rule is re-keyed onto the contract's name and applies for the first time.

  **Angular and Lit still emit `mdy-overlay-panel--*` as of this changeset.** They are unchanged here
  and no worse than before — the class was unstyled then and is unstyled now. Moving them onto the
  contract needs the panel to learn which widget it is holding, which is renderer plumbing rather than
  a stylesheet change; the batches that follow do it, and by release no adapter emits those names.

- e403b6d: The clock is the timepicker's picker, in every renderer

  The dial was Angular's alone: the other renderers showed two number fields, and the framework-free
  one had no container either, so its popup had no width of its own and stretched to fill the viewport.
  The catalog now names the whole anatomy — `container`, `content`, `dialFace`, `dialHand`,
  `dialNumber`, `modeToggle`, `action` — and the foundation places a number from the `--index` it
  carries, so a renderer draws the clock rather than inventing one.

  `MdyTimepickerFieldState.viewMode` is part of the state, with a `set-view-mode` intent: which face
  the popup shows decides what it contains and how tall it is, so a renderer keeping it privately would
  be deciding the widget's anatomy. Every opening starts on the clock, on the hours.
  `timepickerDialNumbers` gives the numbers on the face — the hours, or the minutes in fives with 0 at
  the top — and `timepickerSelectedDialValue` marks the nearest five, so a draft of 07 highlights 05
  rather than nothing.

  The framework-free renderer draws the clock and picks from it: it reports where the pointer is, and
  the angle becomes a time through the contract's `set-from-angle`, the same snapping Angular's clock
  uses. Picking an hour hands over to the minutes, so one gesture sets a whole time. The numbers are
  labels, not controls — the foundation makes them `pointer-events: none`, and the face owns the
  gesture.

- 77f2095: Name every control's parts in the contract, so a theme has a stable hook for each one and an
  adapter never has to invent a class: slider (`mdy-slider-container` / `mdy-slider` /
  `mdy-slider-value`), checkbox and toggle (`mdy-checkbox__control`, `mdy-toggle__control`), radio and
  segmented (group, option, control, label), select and multiselect (trigger, value, arrow, popup,
  search, list, option, chips, chip). The select's filter is now a contract part of its own: it is an
  input at the top of the popup, not typing over the trigger, so the committed value stays visible —
  Plain renders it that way and the DOM gate accepts a portalled popup as the contract's own portal
  capability rather than a containment violation.
- 5a66c4a: Declare outside-pointer dismissal in the contract: every widget that owns an overlay reports
  `capabilities.dismissOnOutsidePointer`, and the decision stays `overlayLifecycleTransition`, so a
  pointer landing outside closes by default and a popup that should not be dismissible has to say so.
  Plain wires it through one shared helper for the select, the pickers, the date range and the colour
  palette.

### Patch Changes

- 602ac27: Milestone B, batch 4: a landmark must be announced with a name.

  Dimension 2's remaining half. `element` already said what a part _is_ and the relations said what it
  points at; nothing said how a screen reader is supposed to announce it. A listbox, a grid or a dialog
  with no accessible name is read as an unlabelled container and the user has to guess what they have
  landed in.

  Declared as a rule rather than a table per kind, because the requirement comes from what the element
  is rather than which widget it appears on. Which mechanism supplies the name — `aria-label`, a
  resolved `aria-labelledby`, a `label[for]`, a wrapping label, or the element's own text — stays the
  renderer's choice, and so does the text, which the renderer has to translate.

  `colors.presets` is corrected from `group` to `listbox`. All three renderers emit `role="listbox"`
  over `role="option"` swatches, so calling it an unconstrained group let the contract have no opinion
  about something every renderer had already agreed on. With the semantic right, the rule applies — and
  found that Plain's palette carried no name where Lit's and Angular's both do.

- 879b5e9: Every renderer measures its popup before placing it

  Angular, Lit and the framework-free renderer now hand `anchorOverlay` the popup's own size, so the
  contract can put it where the content shows whole instead of falling back to the minimum-space rule.
  Each measures once — when the popup opens, with `scrollHeight`/`scrollWidth`, which report what the
  content wants whatever the box is currently clamped to — and holds that size while it stays open:
  re-measuring during scroll would feed the clamped box back into the decision that clamped it. The
  panel is not in the DOM on the frame the popup opens, so each renderer takes the measurement as soon
  as it is and places it again, still within the opening.

  `ComputedPosition["coords"]` carries `maxWidth`, and `getOverlayStyles` emits
  `--mdy-overlay-max-width`, so Angular's panel applies the same width ceiling the other two get from
  the foundation.

  `computeOverlayPosition` and `computeCoordsForAnchor` are deprecated. They are a second placement
  policy that no renderer calls: they know nothing of the popup's size, so they pick a side with
  enough room rather than the side where the content fits.

- cd22e96: An opener names the popup it opens

  Select and multiselect have always declared the full relation: the control that opens the overlay
  says it has one, whether it is showing, and _which_ one. The pickers and the colour field declared
  the first two and never the third — the trigger said `aria-haspopup="grid"` and `aria-expanded`, and
  named nothing, so nothing tied opener to popup for assistive technology.

  `aria-controls` is now declared in the datepicker and timepicker a11y projections, so every adapter
  inherits it, and Plain's daterange and colours wire their own toggles to their popups' ids.

  `MDY_POPUP_OPENERS` also changed to say where the relation actually lives. The pickers follow the
  combobox pattern — the typeable control carries `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded` and now
  `aria-controls`, and the calendar button beside it is a second affordance for the same popup — so
  the opener is the control, not the button. Colours and daterange are the exceptions and really are
  opened by their toggles.

- 33679ba: Each widget declares how its popup attaches

  `capabilities.anchoring` names, per kind, whether the popup matches its control's width and how much
  room it needs — a select's list belongs under its control and as wide as it, a calendar is sized by
  its own content. The renderers read it instead of repeating those numbers, so two adapters can no
  longer choose different widths for the same widget, and `MDY_OVERLAY_PORTAL_CLASS` names the class
  a renderer adds when it lifts a popup out of its field.

  The suite asserts every overlay-capable kind declares its anchoring and carries the shared container
  class, so a new widget cannot be added without saying how its popup attaches.

- 8279dc3: Declarative layout gets a contract, a grid and an audit

  Contract v2 lets a form declare sections and column rows, but what they rendered as was Plain's
  invention and no theme styled any of it. `MDY_LAYOUT_CLASSES`, `MDY_LAYOUT_COLUMN_COUNT_PROPERTY`
  and `layoutNodeAttributes` name that vocabulary, the foundation draws the grid from it — even
  tracks that may shrink, collapsing to a stack below 40rem — and Plain takes its classes from there.

  `scripts/audit-layout-contract.mjs` (wired into `test:contracts`) checks that every class the
  contract names is styled, that an adapter rendering layout consumes the contract rather than
  literals, and lists the adapters that do not render layout yet: Lit and Angular. That gap is
  recorded, not implied.

  The timepicker's `hour` and `minute` now carry distinct modifiers. Sharing one class made the two
  segments indistinguishable — the demo's own conformance banner reported a part-order violation
  because both resolved to the same element.

- 8e1164f: Lit's popups join the top layer, and one function puts every adapter's there

  Lit was the last adapter still laying its popups out in the page. That is not a detail of how a
  popup looks: the coordinates every adapter writes are viewport coordinates, and `position: fixed`
  only means that while no ancestor is a containing block for fixed descendants. `container-type` —
  which the foundation needs so a row can ask how wide its _form_ is rather than how wide the window
  is — makes every ancestor of every field exactly that. A Lit popup was therefore anchored against
  whichever ancestor happened to win, and clipped by any `overflow: hidden` above it.

  `setOverlayOpen` moves from `@modyra/plain` to `@modyra/widgets`, where the rest of the anchoring
  contract lives, and both adapters now call it. Plain re-exports it so its fields keep one import for
  everything overlay. Two adapters calling one function is a contract; two adapters with one copy each
  is a drift waiting to happen — and this one carries a policy decision worth stating once, namely
  `popover="manual"` rather than `auto`, because light dismissal would close a popup before the
  adapter's own outside-pointer handling ran.

  The controller shows it once per popup rather than once per frame — `refresh` runs on every scroll
  frame and `showPopover` throws on an element already showing — and takes it out of the top layer
  explicitly on close, rather than relying on the element being removed, so a renderer that keeps its
  popup in the DOM does not leave a closed one showing.

  Every Lit widget with a popup is covered: jsdom has no top layer, so the assertion is that the popup
  reaches the one function that puts it there, wearing the `manual` policy that function applies.

- db0c39a: Fix the Lit select overlay and the controls around it, and put what was missing under contract:

  - The open panel is positioned by the overlay contract, not by the anchored `top` the theme
    declares for a docked panel — in a later layer that override left the panel with both a `top` and
    a `bottom`, collapsing it to zero height.
  - ARIA states are strings now, so `attributes["aria-expanded"] ? …` was always true; the Lit select
    read them as booleans and rendered an expanded, disabled trigger.
  - The segmented control's segment count is part of the contract (`MdyPartContract.style`), so every
    adapter emits `--mdy-segments-count` and the theme's tick gutter is right everywhere; the modern
    theme no longer applies the radio group's `align-items: start` to the segmented bar, which had
    left every segment 18px tall inside a 44px control.
  - The multiselect names its `placeholder` part, like the select, and always renders a trigger — an
    empty, unselectable box was the previous state with nothing chosen.
  - Prefix and suffix are rendered only when something is projected into them.
  - Listbox navigation is named in the contract (`listboxNavigationIndex`, which clamps) beside
    `optionNavigationIndex` (which wraps), so an adapter takes the right one rather than importing a
    lookalike.

- 3f2e9d0: The multiselect's popup is one anatomy, not one per renderer

  Angular's multiselect draws a header holding the filter, a grid of option chips, each chip in its own
  wrapper, and marks a taken option with a modifier. None of that was named, so another renderer could
  only produce a list that happened to hold the same words. The catalog now names `popupHeader` and
  `optionWrapper`, the listbox carries the grid class every adapter must emit, and the chips carry
  their state as modifiers — `mdy-chip--selected`, with `--counter` or `--centered` for the mode —
  which is what a theme styles.

  The framework-free renderer draws that anatomy: the filter in the header, each option chip in its
  wrapper inside the grid, and the selected modifier on a chip in either mode.

- f5ee72d: No package names one it must not know about, and an audit keeps it that way.

  `scripts/audit-package-independence.mjs` runs in `test:contracts`. The rule it enforces:
  `@modyra/core` and `@modyra/widgets` are the contract and name no adapter at all; an adapter may name
  itself and nothing else. Siblings are peers, not references.

  It found **58 comments** across five packages, all the same shape — "modeled on Angular's real
  component", "the same structure the themes style for the Angular renderer", "the answer Angular
  kept", "Plain and Angular come through `current`". A framework-free renderer explaining its anatomy
  by naming the framework one is the same inversion as the contract doing it, one layer down; and a
  contract that cites a consumer is describing the wrong thing.

  The import graph was clean throughout, which is why none of this was caught: nothing here is a
  dependency, so nothing objects at build time. The audit checks file names too — that half is what an
  `angular-ui.json` sitting in the widgets package would have failed.

  `plain` counts only when spelled `@modyra/plain`, because it is also an ordinary adjective: a plain
  button, a plain array.

- 351c0ed: A popup opens from the end of its control where the trigger is

  Which corner an overlay opened from used to depend on the pointer against the middle of the
  _viewport_, so the same calendar opened from the left corner on a form in one column and the right
  corner on another, and clicking a different part of the same field changed it again. Each widget now
  declares the edge its popup hangs from in `capabilities.anchoring.alignment` — every trigger in the
  catalog sits at the end of its control, so every popup opens from that end and stays there. Only a
  content width that will not fit that side can overrule it. Where no widget declares an edge, the
  pointer picks the half of _the control_ it landed in, which is the comparison that was wrong before.

  `overlayAnchoringFor(kind)` returns a widget's anchoring as `anchorOverlay` options. Angular, Lit and
  the framework-free renderer all take their popup's room, width and edge from it, so a renderer no
  longer holds numbers of its own — Angular's controls were flipping sides at 128px where the contract
  says 180 for a list and 240 for a calendar.

- 9d7b426: Give the boolean controls the anatomy Angular and Lit already render: one clickable
  `.mdy-checkbox` / `.mdy-toggle` wrapper holding the input, the drawn `.mdy-toggle__track` >
  `.mdy-toggle__thumb`, and the text after it. A switch is a checkbox input with `role="switch"`, and
  the wrapper — not the input — carries the component class. The theme's Plain-only
  `.mdy-switch-control` and input-drawn checkbox rules are gone with the markup that needed them.
- ecfb325: Show the committed value in the control that opened the overlay. Committing restores focus to the
  trigger, so the focus-guarded sync skipped exactly the update that mattered: a date picked from the
  calendar never reached the input, and a selected option left the stale search text in the select
  trigger. The sync is now guarded by whether the user is typing.
- 9f0170d: Render every one of the seventeen Widgets catalog kinds, including `daterange`, `file` and `colors`.
- e7f3189: Milestone B, batch 2: the references between a widget's parts are contract data.

  `MDY_WIDGET_RELATIONS` declares, per kind, which part names which other part and with what attribute —
  the label's `for`, the control's `aria-describedby`, a group's `aria-labelledby`, an opener's
  `aria-controls`. These existed in two places and neither was the contract: the projections emitted
  them at runtime and the conformance inspector restated the rules in its own code. A rule that lives
  only in the checker cannot be read by someone implementing the widget, which is what this contract
  exists to make possible.

  Declaring them changes what can be caught. The inspector could only ever find a reference pointing at
  nothing — a _dangling_ id. A part carrying no reference at all has nothing to dangle, so a field
  whose errors reached no assistive technology looked exactly like one with no errors. Two shipped
  defects of that shape turned up immediately:

  - **A select described itself to nobody.** `projectSelectA11y` never emitted `aria-describedby`, so
    the two adapters that consume the projection linked no errors to the trigger at all. The projection
    now makes the relation, and the renderer says which of the description or the error list is on
    screen — `aria-describedby` must name an element that exists.
  - **A Lit radio group did the same.** The projection offered the attribute and the renderer restated
    its neighbours by hand, dropping it.

  `label[for]` is also checked against the HTML rule that it may only name a labelable element.

  **Breaking for `@modyra/angular`**: `MdyFormComponent` takes a second type parameter, `TSubmit`,
  defaulting to `Partial<T>`. It previously pinned that default, which made a typed form's own precise
  submit type unassignable to it — `[form]="typedForm"` did not compile, and the demo build had been
  failing. Callers naming the component's type explicitly gain a parameter with a default.

- 88b57b4: The clock face is a control, and a time keeps its formalism on screen

  Two things a time picker was getting wrong, both now decided once in `@modyra/widgets`.

  **The face ignored the format.** `timepickerDialNumbers` always answered 1–12, whatever the picker
  was set to — so a 24-hour picker held `14:00` as a value and offered no 14 to point at. The hour was
  reachable by typing and by dragging the hand, and not by the control that exists to pick it. A face
  that offers twelve hours on a twenty-four hour clock is telling the user something untrue about what
  they are editing. It now answers the hours the format has: **1–12 with an AM/PM toggle beside them,
  or 0–23 with none**, the second twelve on an inner ring at the same twelve positions, exactly as a
  clock has always done. `00` rather than `24`, because midnight is the hour a 24-hour clock names.

  **The face had no keyboard at all.** It listened for `mousedown` and `touchstart` and nothing else:
  no role, no value, no focus. Every number on it was reachable only by dragging a hand around a
  circle — the one gesture a keyboard cannot make and a screen reader cannot describe.
  `timepickerDialKeyIntent` is the policy, once: arrows turn the hand clockwise, Home and End go to the
  ends of _this_ face, PageUp/PageDown turn a quarter of it, and everything **wraps** — a clock is a
  ring, and clamping at the end of a circle is the one behaviour a dial cannot justify. It never
  produces an hour the format does not have, and the test walks every key from every hour in both
  formats to say so.

  `timepickerDialAria` gives the face `role="slider"` with the bounds the keyboard uses, so what a
  screen reader announces and what the arrows reach cannot drift apart — asserted against each other
  rather than written twice.

  Angular leads and Lit and plain call the same function, so all three faces show the same hours.
  Clicking a number also stopped calling every hour a 12-hour one, which turned every afternoon on a
  24-hour face into a morning.

  `inner` joins the state vocabulary and the `dialNumber` part declares it, so the ring a renderer drew
  a number on is named by the contract rather than spelled in three templates.

  Recorded while here: the golden audit walks `.ts` files only, and this widget keeps its template in a
  separate `.html`. Everything that clock renders — including the ARIA added here — is invisible to it.

- b3aa842: The 24-hour face really shows twenty-four hours, and the keyboard can be reached

  Three things stood between the previous change and it working, and only one of them was the change.

  **A component stylesheet was quietly overruling the foundation.**
  `timepicker-renderer.component.scss` carried its own copy of `.mdy-timepicker-dial__number` —
  byte-for-byte the foundation's rule, transform included. Component styles are
  emulated-encapsulation, so they wear an attribute selector and outrank the foundation wherever the
  two speak: the inner ring drew at the _outer_ radius and every second hour sat on top of a first
  one. Twenty-four numbers were there all along, twelve of them hidden behind the others. Removed —
  the foundation said the same thing — and measured after: outer radius 100, inner 60.

  **Nothing gave the dial focus.** The face has been focusable since it became a slider, but
  `restoreOverlayTriggerFocus` runs on _close_, so opening the picker left focus on the toggle and the
  first arrow went to the page. The dial takes focus when the picker opens on it, and when a user
  switches to it from the number boxes.

  Focusing on open is not enough on its own, so **the arrows now work from anywhere in the clock** —
  except a text input, because the hour and minute boxes have their own arrow handling and taking their
  keys would make them impossible to correct. The difference matters: reach for Confirm to commit and
  the arrows would otherwise go dead. The handler lives on the clock root, not on the face as well;
  left on both, a keydown on the face would bubble and turn the hand twice.

  **And the mark could land on the wrong hour.** `timepickerSelectedDialValue` still answered the
  12-hour hour while the face offered 0–23, so at 14:00 Lit and plain marked `2`. It takes the format
  now and answers in the units the face shows — the same rule that decides which numbers are on it,
  because the numbers and the mark disagreeing is only a matter of time otherwise. Tested for every
  hour of the day, and for midnight and noon, which is where an off-by-twelve hides.

  The demo test compares the two pickers against each other rather than against remembered numbers,
  and it scopes to the picker it opened: a closed overlay panel is `visibility: hidden`, which still
  has a box, so "the first face with a height" finds the picker nobody opened. That mistake cost two
  measurements before it was noticed.

- 9e8d1c8: A disabled multiselect leaves no operable chips behind

  The multiselect renders its options twice — once in the field, once in the popup — and only the
  popup's grid applied the contract part. The reason was sound as far as it went: the part carries an
  `id` and a `hidden` flag, and only one of the two grids can own the id while only the popup filters.

  Taking nothing at all for the field grid was too blunt. Everything else the part says is true of
  both chips, so a disabled multiselect left two live buttons in the field: no `disabled`, no
  `aria-disabled`, still clickable. The field grid now applies the part with the id and the filtering
  dropped.

- f759e3d: The DOM contract is now checked with the overlay open.

  Every conformance suite inspected widgets at rest, and a resting overlay widget renders none of its
  popup. **Forty-five parts across six kinds** — the listbox and its options, the calendar grid and its
  cells, the clock face — had their classes, parents, order, semantics and cardinality checked nowhere
  at all. `overlayOnlyParts` names them, which is what made the scope a measurement rather than a
  guess; 38 of the 45 are rendered by an open widget and are now inspected.

  Defects it found, all in shipped renderers:

  - **Lit's calendars had no grid semantics.** Rows carried `role="row"` and weekdays
    `role="columnheader"`, but the grid had no `role="grid"` and the day cells no `role="gridcell"` —
    rows floating outside any grid, which is not a structure assistive technology can navigate. Plain
    had it right, which is how the contract was confirmed rather than assumed.
  - **Four Lit overlays never named what they controlled.** The datepicker, daterange, timepicker and
    multiselect openers carried `aria-expanded` and no `aria-controls`, and the popups they open had no
    id to name. The reference is emitted only while open, so a closed overlay does not dangle.
  - **Lit's select trigger dropped `role` and `aria-describedby`** from the projection it otherwise
    reads attribute by attribute — the third defect of that shape.
  - **Lit's multiselect label named a `<div>`**, which `label[for]` cannot resolve. It now names the
    search button, the opener the contract declares.
  - **Lit's colour palette put `role="listbox"` on the panel that positions it** rather than on the
    grid of swatches whose children are the options.
  - **Plain's pickers rendered no calendar frame.** Lit and Angular both emit
    `mdy-datepicker__calendar` and two themes lay it out, so Plain's date pickers were arranged by
    rules that could not reach them.

  Three contract corrections came out of it: `mdy-overlay-backdrop` and `mdy-timepicker-segment-label`
  were emitted by renderers and declared nowhere, and `right` becomes a declared popup placement state
  — an adapter's own comment recorded that it had to spell that class as a literal "because the catalog
  declares no alignment state".

  The multiselect's value area is declared before its header. That order used to fall out of the
  sequence the part names happened to be written in, which is not a decision, and it put the
  placeholder after the affordance that changes it — which no renderer does.

- 026cf08: The slider colours its track

  Reported: the slider's bar never filled. Two things were wrong, and each one alone was enough.

  `@modyra/plain` never wrote `--mdy-slider-fill-pct`, so the gradient sat on its `0%` fallback no
  matter where the handle went. It writes it now, on the control, which is the element the gradient is
  composed on.

  Even written, nothing painted it. `.mdy-input-wrapper input:not(.mdy-checkbox)` sets `background:
transparent` to flatten a text control's frame, and at `(0,2,1)` it erased the split track composed
  on `.mdy-slider` at `(0,1,0)` — for every renderer, not only plain. The slider joins the checkbox in
  that exemption: both draw themselves.

  Then it filled to the wrong place. A range input's handle travels by its **centre**, from `thumb/2`
  to `100% - thumb/2`, so a stop written at `ratio × 100%` follows the element rather than the handle
  and misses it by `thumb × (ratio − 0.5)` — measured at −10px, 0px and +10px across the range, right
  only at the midpoint. The stop is now `thumb/2 + ratio × (100% − thumb)`, taken from
  `--mdy-slider-thumb-size`, so a theme that resizes the handle stays aligned for free.

  That correction has to happen in CSS, because the handle's size is a theme token and a renderer that
  knew it would be drawing the theme. CSS can only do it given a unitless number: `calc()` cannot
  divide by a percentage to recover `0.3` from `30%`.

  **`--mdy-slider-fill-pct` is therefore no longer the property to write.** Renderers write
  `--mdy-slider-fill`, a ratio in 0–1. Anything that _reads_ `--mdy-slider-fill-pct` keeps working — it
  is still declared, derived from the ratio on the control itself. Anything that _writes_ it directly
  no longer has an effect and should move to `--mdy-slider-fill`.

  How far along the value sits is now `sliderFillRatio` in `@modyra/widgets`, one calculation instead
  of one per adapter. Angular and Lit had disagreed about a range with no width — Angular answered
  `0`, Lit divided by a nudged denominator — and `0` is the answer that degrades to an empty track
  instead of an arbitrary one. A value that is absent or not a number fills to the minimum rather than
  painting `NaN`.

- a613ac8: A range, a colour and a file field announce their state

  `daterange`, `colors` and `file` are rendered without a widgets controller — the range policy, the
  colour transitions and the file selection all live in `@modyra/widgets`, and the renderers own only
  DOM and events. What went with that split by accident was the accessibility projection: nothing
  built one for these three, so they applied the _static_ part contract and nothing state-driven.

  The state matrix caught six rows of it — `aria-invalid` and `aria-disabled` absent on all three. The
  hole was wider than the rows. There was no `aria-required` and no `aria-describedby` either, so the
  error list was rendered, styled, and tied to nothing: a screen reader was never told a range was
  invalid, and never told why.

  `projectFieldShellA11y` is new in `@modyra/widgets` — the shared half of `projectFieldA11y` with the
  input's own concerns left out, since `type`, `inputmode`, `autocomplete` and `readonly` all belong
  to a text control and none of these three kinds is one. The Plain renderers apply it, and the shell
  label now names a control on all three.

- 095fff8: Milestone B, batch 3: the contract says what a widget _does_.

  `MDY_WIDGET_TRANSITIONS` declares, per kind, which user action moves an overlay between open and
  closed, and whether closing returns focus to the opener. The anatomy said a select has a popup and
  the state contract said it may be open; neither said that clicking the trigger opens it or that
  Escape closes it. Those are the parts a user experiences, and they existed only as the behaviour of
  two shared functions.

  The table is written independently of those functions rather than derived from them — a declaration
  read out of the implementation it checks is not a check — and `overlayLifecycleTransition`, which all
  three renderers route through, is held to it. `widgetKeyIntent` is held to it too, but that function
  has no adapter consumer: every renderer implements its own key handling.

  Declaring it alone would have proved nothing, so all three adapters now **replay** the transition
  against a real DOM: open the overlay, press Escape where focus actually is, and assert the opener's
  `aria-expanded` — the contract's own statement of open-ness, and the one signal every adapter
  carries. Five shipped defects turned up, none of them visible to any existing check:

  - **Plain's daterange and colours** bound Escape inside a popup that never takes focus, so the
    handler could only fire if the user had already reached into it. Both could be opened from the
    keyboard and not closed.
  - **Plain's timepicker** had no Escape handler at all.
  - **Lit's multiselect** defined a correct Escape handler and never bound it — unreachable code.
  - **Lit's timepicker and colours** had the same popup-only binding as Plain's.

  Angular had none: it closes on Escape on every overlay kind.

- b4b236d: Make filtering part of the contract: an option a query does not match is projected as `hidden`
  (plus a `--hidden` class) by the select and multiselect controllers, so every renderer filters
  identically by applying the part instead of reimplementing the match. The theme stops its own
  `display` from beating `[hidden]` on options and chips.
- 9c8a238: Emit the canonical class vocabulary from the widget controllers: `mdy-description` becomes
  `mdy-supporting-text`, `mdy-error` becomes `mdy-control__errors`, the control part carries no
  `mdy-input` class of its own, and `aria-modal` is emitted as the string `"true"`. Plain builds its
  field shell from the contract (so a radio group is `mdy-renderer--radio-group`, as in Angular and
  Lit) and no longer stacks a duplicated class on a part.
- 0310e27: `@modyra/widgets` stops holding one adapter's material, and a test now keeps it that way.

  `contract-baseline/` held `angular-ui.json` — a record of the Angular renderer's own surface, whose
  metadata names `packages/angular/src/lib/{control,renderers}` as its source — and an `angular-dom/`
  directory beside it. They sat in the framework-agnostic package's own baseline directory, next to
  what the _catalogue_ declares. Nothing imported them, so nothing complained: the import graph was
  clean the whole time, which is exactly why this kind of inversion survives. They now live in
  `packages/angular/contract-baseline/`, where the surface they describe is.

  `widget-completeness.json` stays: it records this package's own anatomy.

  `independence.spec.mjs` asserts both halves of the rule — no file in this package may be named after
  a package derived from it, and no comment may cite one as the contract's reference. It found twelve
  comments in the tests that an earlier sweep of `src/` had missed, all of the same shape ("modeled on
  Angular's real component", "the answer Angular kept"). A contract that explains itself by naming one
  of its consumers is describing the wrong thing.

  Also fixes a real defect the equivalence work exposed: Plain's multiselect applied the projection's
  `trigger` part wholesale to its search button, so the button carried `mdy-multiselect` — the
  catalogue's class for `inputWrapper` — and one class named two elements. The button now takes the
  part's semantics without its classes.
