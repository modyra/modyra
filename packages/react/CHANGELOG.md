### Patch Changes

- 08cb845: Every adapter's conformance suite runs the reactivity that package actually exports.

  `@modyra/preact`, `@modyra/react`, `@modyra/svelte` and `@modyra/lit` each ship a named
  `*Reactivity()` — core's graph re-tagged with their own `kind`, which the capability matrix
  introspects. **Every one of their conformance files ran `vanillaReactivity()` instead.** The export
  consumers import was covered by nothing, and a re-tag is a spread: the one shape that silently drops
  a member.

  It does now, plus a check that the re-tag still carries every member. Removing `createScope` from
  one of them fails eleven tests; before this it failed none.

  The backward-compatibility shim `core/test/reactivity-contract.mjs` is **gone**. It existed to adapt
  the old `runReactivityContract(name, factory)` signature for "every adapter package's own
  `test/reactivity.test.mjs`", and no adapter uses that signature any more. It also hardcoded
  `destroy: () => {}` and an immediate flush, so nothing tested through it was ever asked to tear down
  or to flush.

- 342f396: These packages are now compiled by TypeScript 7.

  Nothing about the published API changes, and that is checked rather than asserted: both compilers
  emit all twenty-one projects and the results are compared file by file. Across 464 files the only
  difference is the order in which the members of a string-literal union are printed in
  `catalog.d.ts` — the same type either way. The contract snapshot is unmoved, and the Angular package
  still builds through its own TypeScript 5.9 toolchain from these declarations.

  The Angular package and Studio's embedded compiler stay on TypeScript 5.9, which their peer ranges
  and its package exports require.

### Patch Changes

- fbd6e09: A headless consumer can arrange a form from the contract

  This was planned as "render `layout` in react, preact, vue, svelte and solid", on the understanding
  that five adapters consumed the contract and dropped its arrangement. They do not: **they render
  nothing at all.** They ship hooks, composables and command runtimes, and the consumer brings the
  markup. An arrangement cannot be missing from a package with no elements to arrange, so there was no
  renderer to write — and the gap was somewhere else.

  `@modyra/react`'s dynamic form said `layout` was unapplied "matching the Angular renderer's own
  documented gap, not a new one". That stopped being true when `<mdy-dynamic-form>` learned to render
  layout, so the one place a consumer would look for this explained the situation with a fact that had
  expired. It now says what is actually the case, and points at the two functions that do the work.

  The layout audit reported "Adapters rendering layout: 2/2" while never mentioning the other five,
  which reads as "every adapter" and means "both of the two that render". It now names the headless
  packages as what they are, and checks that `layoutNodeAttributes` and `layoutSlotStyle` are still
  exported — because for a headless consumer those two functions are the entire feature, and nothing
  else was guarding them.

  The recipe is in `docs/guides/headless-recipes.md`, mirrored in a test like every other helper in
  that guide: a walk over a layout node that produces the same classes and the same `--mdy-layout-*`
  properties both rendering adapters produce. Its first draft spelled a property by hand and asserted
  against one that does not exist, which is the mistake the recipe tells you to avoid — so it takes
  the names from the contract, and says why in a comment.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bb844f: Reactivity/adapter API redesign (`piano-modyra-reactivity-adapter-api.md`), all additive:

  - `MdyReactivity` gains optional `id`/`kind`/`capabilities` (honest, per-adapter, never claiming an unimplemented guarantee), `createScope()`/`MdyReactiveScope` (ownership with idempotent, cascading destroy), typed errors (`MdyUnsupportedCapabilityError`, `MdyCrossRuntimeObservationError`, `MdyDestroyedScopeError`, `MdyAdapterContractError`, `MdyActivationError`) and structured diagnostics (`MdyDiagnostics`, `MDY_*` codes). `canEffect` stays as a deprecated alias.
  - `vanillaReactivity()` is the reference implementation: real `batch()`, `flush()` and `observe()` (a selector-based subscription that only fires on an actual change), built on a redesigned shared-drain effect scheduler that settles chained effect triggers within one flush/batch instead of needing one microtask per hop.
  - `MdyFormEngine`/`MdyTypedFormBase` gain `form.mutate(fn)` — coalesces a burst of field writes into exactly one history entry regardless of whether the adapter's effects run synchronously (Vue/Solid) or are scheduler-deferred (vanilla/Angular); delegates to a real runtime `batch()` when the adapter reports it.
  - `MdyFormEngineOptions.autoActivate` (default `true`, unchanged behavior) plus `activate()`/`deactivate()`: pause/resume draft persistence, history recording and async validators without losing any state (field values, undo/redo stacks, draft baseline). `@modyra/react` and `@modyra/preact`'s `useMdyForm` now construct with `autoActivate: false` and call `activate()`/`deactivate()` from their effect instead of destroying on unmount — tolerant of React/Preact Strict Mode's dev-only double-invoke and safe during SSR (activation only ever runs client-side). **Behavior note**: the hook no longer calls `form.destroy()` automatically on unmount; call it yourself if you need a hard, final teardown (releasing field records) rather than a pause.
  - `@modyra/angular`'s adapter hardened: `effect()` without an `Injector` now throws a typed error by default instead of returning a silent no-op (`unsupported: "report"` opts back into graceful, diagnosed degradation); declared capabilities; `equal` propagated to Angular's native `signal()`/`computed()`; `onError` now actually respected (previously silently ignored).
  - Fixed a real, if latent, bug in `@modyra/react`/`@modyra/preact`: `createStore()` used to build a fresh `vanillaReactivity()` to observe a field handle, which happened to work only because vanilla's tracking is module-global — it silently never re-rendered for a handle owned by a different adapter's form. Now resolves the owner via a new handle-ownership registry (`getFieldHandleOwner()`).
  - Fixed a real pre-existing bug found while building `mutate()`: `undo()`/`redo()` restore a value through the same non-atomic multi-field write path `mutate()` guards against, so a synchronous-effect adapter could see 1-2 spurious extra history entries mid-restore.
  - Fixed a scheduler bug found while auditing error handling: an effect throwing without `onError` used to abort the shared drain loop, silently starving sibling effects scheduled in the same batch.
  - New `@modyra/core/testing` subpath (`runReactivityContractTests`, `MdyReactivityTestHarness`) — the conformance suite adapters are tested against, now a documented public API instead of an internal test helper.
  - New `docs/guides/reactivity-adapter-guide.md` and a generated `docs/reactivity-capability-matrix.md` (`npm run docs:reactivity-matrix`).
