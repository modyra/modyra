### Patch Changes

- 6921584: A rule declares what it enforces, and the control offers it.

  `maxLength(50)` used to let someone type five hundred characters and hear about it afterwards: the
  constraint reached the error list and never the input. Only `min`/`max` on numbers had made the
  crossing, and each renderer wrote those by hand.

  Now every rule with a native counterpart declares it — `required`, `min`, `max`, `integer` (a step of
  one), `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `email` — a field reports the total as
  `MdyFieldState.constraints` / `MdyFieldHandle.constraints`, and every renderer offers what its kind
  can carry. The translation lives in `@modyra/widgets` (`nativeConstraintAttributes`), once. A rule
  with no native counterpart declares nothing and stays exactly what it was.

  **A declared fact now survives composition.** `compose()` and `composeFirst()` carry the sum of what
  they combine. This fixes a silent defect as old as `compose`: `compose(required(), maxLength(3))`
  produced a field that was **not marked required** — no `aria-required`, nothing for a screen reader.
  Where two rules bound the same thing the tightest wins; two different patterns cancel, because an
  input carries one and their intersection is a rule nobody wrote.

  **A Zod schema crosses over untouched**: `z.string().min(3).max(8)` reaches `minlength`/`maxlength`.
  Only what has a native counterpart crosses — `z.number().gt(10)` deliberately does not, since
  `min="10"` would admit exactly the value it refuses.

  **The boundary is the model.** Attributes constrain typing. A value arriving from a draft, a server
  or `set()` is kept whole and judged by the rules, as ADR 0029 requires of a widget.

  Also in this change:

  - **A conditional section now covers the collections inside it**, rows already declared included.
    _Out of play if any condition says no_ was written three times and one copy did not know about the
    others; it is written once now, in `conditions.ts`.
  - **`createForm` forwards `devWarnings`.** The switch the guides promised for silencing development
    diagnostics could not be reached from a typed form at all.
  - New development diagnostics, each silent in the ordinary case: a binding that cannot put back in
    play what the schema left out, two patterns that cancel each other, and a `when` predicate that
    gives two answers for the same value.

  `MdyFieldState.bounds`, added in an unreleased changeset, is now `constraints` and carries the whole
  family. Nothing published ever had it.

  See ADR 0030.

- 596419f: `z.record()` becomes a keyed collection instead of one opaque field.

  The adapter mapped `z.object()` to a group and `z.array()` to a typed field array; everything else
  became a leaf, and `z.record()` fell there. The result was a single field holding the whole object:
  no rows, no `upsert`/`remove`, no cells, nothing a renderer could draw — and, because a record
  rejects `null`, a form invalid from its first moment with "expected record, received null" and no
  way to fix it short of `set()`ing the entire object. The engine has had keyed collections since
  ADR 0026, and `@modyra/standard-schema` already honoured them; only the adapter that _derives_ the
  tree did not.

  A `z.record(key, value)` now builds a record whose row is a group when the value is a `z.object()`
  and a leaf otherwise — the same choice the array branch already makes on its element. Its initial
  value follows the same rule as arrays: whatever the piece parses `undefined` into, else no rows.

  **Migration.** If you have a `z.record()` in a schema, `form.f.<name>` is now a record handle rather
  than a field handle: read `form.getValue().<name>` for the object, and use `upsert(key, row)`,
  `remove(key)`, `rename(from, to)` and `cell(key, field)` where you previously wrote `set()` with a
  whole object. The value shape is unchanged.

  Nothing else changes: `z.tuple()`, `z.set()` and `z.map()` stay single fields — the engine has
  no node for them, and inventing one would declare a structure the schema does not. Note that zod's
  own `z.record(z.enum([...]), …)` requires every enum key to be present, so such a record is invalid
  while it is empty; that is the schema's rule, not the adapter's.

### Patch Changes

- 342f396: These packages are now compiled by TypeScript 7.

  Nothing about the published API changes, and that is checked rather than asserted: both compilers
  emit all twenty-one projects and the results are compared file by file. Across 464 files the only
  difference is the order in which the members of a string-literal union are printed in
  `catalog.d.ts` — the same type either way. The contract snapshot is unmoved, and the Angular package
  still builds through its own TypeScript 5.9 toolchain from these declarations.

  The Angular package and Studio's embedded compiler stay on TypeScript 5.9, which their peer ranges
  and its package exports require.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e9a293: Add `serverValidate(schema, payload)` to `@modyra/zod` (sync) and
  `@modyra/standard-schema` (async) — full-schema server-side validation
  returning the same `MdyFormError[]` shape a `form.submit()` action does,
  so one schema and one error shape feed both client and server rejection.
  See the new "one schema, two sides" guide
  (`docs/guides/server-validation.md`) for Next.js/Express/Hono examples.

  Introduce `@modyra/solid`, a Solid binding for the form engine
  (`solidReactivity`, `createSolidForm`, `useSolidForm`) running on Solid's
  native signals, plus the headless widgets bridge (`useMdyField`,
  `useMdySelect`, `executeSolidCommands`) and an `examples/solid/` demo.
  The headless-recipes doc section is tracked as follow-up work.

  Introduce `@modyra/preact`, a thin variant of `@modyra/react` on
  `preact/hooks` + `preact/compat`'s `useSyncExternalStore`. Includes the
  widgets bridge, the React adapter's headless-recipes suite ported
  verbatim (same test file, same assertions — the recipes only touch the
  framework-agnostic field handle), and an `examples/preact/` demo.

  Framework examples for both new adapters are wired into
  `build:examples`/`demo:solid`/`demo:preact` and ship the same signup demo
  (schema validators, cross-field password check, draft persistence,
  undo/redo, cancellable server-side username check) already shown in
  `examples/react` and `examples/vue`.

  `docs/guides/headless-recipes.md` gains a Preact note (the recipes work
  unchanged) and a full Solid section (handles read as accessors directly
  in JSX, no subscription hook) — both verbatim-tested in their adapters'
  `headless-recipes.test.mjs`.

  Introduce `@modyra/svelte`, running the engine on `vanillaReactivity()`
  plus a `toStore()` helper that adapts any Modyra signal into a real
  Svelte `Readable` (`get()`/`$store` syntax both work, verified against
  `svelte/store` directly). Deliberately stores-based, not runes-based:
  Svelte 5's runes are compiler macros unusable in a plain `tsc`-built
  package, while `svelte/store` is ordinary JavaScript — this keeps
  `@modyra/svelte` buildable and testable the same way as every other
  adapter (`tsc` + `node --test`, no new toolchain). A runes-based
  ergonomic layer is a separate, larger follow-up decision (see the
  package README). Includes the headless widgets bridge (`useMdyField`,
  `useMdySelect`, `executeSvelteCommands`) exposing state/view as
  `Readable` stores. No `examples/svelte` yet (needs a Svelte-aware
  bundler for a real `.svelte` file, a separate decision).
