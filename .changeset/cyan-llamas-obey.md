Fix invalid `aria-expanded` on datepicker, daterange and timepicker text inputs (axe `aria-allowed-attr`, critical): the expanded state now lives on the toggle button that controls the overlay, matching the APG date-picker-dialog pattern. Adds axe-core accessibility tests over the main renderers and a Playwright browser smoke test over the packaged demo.
