Injection prevention at the engine's write choke point. New `security` form option: sanitization profiles (`"text"` strips control/bidi/zero-width characters, `"strict"` also strips markup characters), per-field overrides and custom sanitizer functions via `field(..., { sanitize })`, `maxValueLength` string caps, and an `onViolation` telemetry hook. Always-on structural checks: restored draft entries are shape-validated against the declared field type, and submit-returned errors with prototype-polluting paths are dropped. Sanitization is opt-in in 0.x (`"off"` by default) and covers every write path — user input, `patch`/`setValue`, draft restore, array operations. See `docs/guides/security.md`.
