Reactivity/adapter API redesign (`piano-modyra-reactivity-adapter-api.md`), all additive:

- `MdyReactivity` gains optional `id`/`kind`/`capabilities` (honest, per-adapter, never claiming an unimplemented guarantee), `createScope()`/`MdyReactiveScope` (ownership with idempotent, cascading destroy), typed errors (`MdyUnsupportedCapabilityError`, `MdyCrossRuntimeObservationError`, `MdyDestroyedScopeError`, `MdyAdapterContractError`, `MdyActivationError`) and structured diagnostics (`MdyDiagnostics`, `MDY_*` codes). `canEffect` stays as a deprecated alias.
- `vanillaReactivity()` is the reference implementation: real `batch()`, `flush()` and `observe()` (a selector-based subscription that only fires on an actual change), built on a redesigned shared-drain effect scheduler that settles chained effect triggers within one flush/batch instead of needing one microtask per hop.
- `MdyFormEngine`/`MdyTypedFormBase` gain `form.mutate(fn)` — coalesces a burst of field writes into exactly one history entry regardless of whether the adapter's effects run synchronously (Vue/Solid) or are scheduler-deferred (vanilla/Angular); delegates to a real runtime `batch()` when the adapter reports it.
- `MdyFormEngineOptions.autoActivate` (default `true`, unchanged behavior) plus `activate()`/`deactivate()`: pause/resume draft persistence, history recording and async validators without losing any state (field values, undo/redo stacks, draft baseline). `@modyra/react` and `@modyra/preact`'s `useMdyForm` now construct with `autoActivate: false` and call `activate()`/`deactivate()` from their effect instead of destroying on unmount — tolerant of React/Preact Strict Mode's dev-only double-invoke and safe during SSR (activation only ever runs client-side). **Behavior note**: the hook no longer calls `form.destroy()` automatically on unmount; call it yourself if you need a hard, final teardown (releasing field records) rather than a pause.
- `@modyra/angular`'s adapter hardened: `effect()` without an `Injector` now throws a typed error by default instead of returning a silent no-op (`unsupported: "report"` opts back into graceful, diagnosed degradation); real capabilities; `equal` propagated to Angular's native `signal()`/`computed()`; `onError` now actually respected (previously silently ignored).
- Fixed a real, if latent, bug in `@modyra/react`/`@modyra/preact`: `createStore()` used to build a fresh `vanillaReactivity()` to observe a field handle, which happened to work only because vanilla's tracking is module-global — it silently never re-rendered for a handle owned by a different adapter's form. Now resolves the real owner via a new handle-ownership registry (`getFieldHandleOwner()`).
- Fixed a real pre-existing bug found while building `mutate()`: `undo()`/`redo()` restore a value through the same non-atomic multi-field write path `mutate()` guards against, so a synchronous-effect adapter could see 1-2 spurious extra history entries mid-restore.
- Fixed a scheduler bug found while auditing error handling: an effect throwing without `onError` used to abort the shared drain loop, silently starving sibling effects scheduled in the same batch.
- New `@modyra/core/testing` subpath (`runReactivityContractTests`, `MdyReactivityTestHarness`) — the conformance suite adapters are tested against, now a documented public API instead of an internal test helper.
- New `docs/guides/reactivity-adapter-guide.md` and a generated `docs/reactivity-capability-matrix.md` (`npm run docs:reactivity-matrix`).
